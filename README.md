# enhancer.annotator
Given the interactions file mapping enhancers to their respective promoters, annotate an arbitrary set of loci (enhnacers).

## Usage
./annotate.enhancers.with.genes.sh TARGET_FILE INTERACTIONS_FILE

TARGET_FILE - path to file in bed format containing regions to be annotated. Only 3 columns are required: Chr Start End. All other fileds are ignored.

INTERACTIONS_FILE - path to file containing promoter-enhancer interaction mappings as generated by epitensor and extended with Gene annatations. The file for mm10 assembly is included: annotated.all_chr_tss_enh_interactions.mm10.bed
